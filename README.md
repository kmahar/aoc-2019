# aoc-2019
This repository contains my solutions to the 2019 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I will attempt to keep it as up-to-date as possible throughout the month as I complete the daily puzzles.

All of these solutions are/will be written using Swift 5.1.

Each day's solution is in a correspondingly named file, e.g. Day 1 is in `Day1.swift`.

In order to run a solution for a particular day, update the call to `runDay` in `main.swift` to pass in the desired day, and then call `swift run` from within the project's root directory.
